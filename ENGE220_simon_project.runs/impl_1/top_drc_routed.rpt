2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deb_s0/D[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deb_s0/seq_timer_reset_reg_i_2/O, cell deb_s0/seq_timer_reset_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deb_s0/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deb_s0/n_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell deb_s0/n_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deb_s2/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deb_s2/color_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell deb_s2/color_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_enable_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_enable_reg_i_2/O, cell led_enable_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net rand_reset_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rand_reset_reg_i_2/O, cell rand_reset_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net randomize_reg_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin randomize_reg_i_2/O, cell randomize_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
