2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deb_s0/c_state_reg[3] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deb_s0/seq_count_reset_reg_i_2/O, cell deb_s0/seq_count_reset_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deb_s0/c_state_reg[3]_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deb_s0/seq_timer_reset_reg_i_2/O, cell deb_s0/seq_timer_reset_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net led_enable_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin led_enable_reg_i_2/O, cell led_enable_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net non_seq_b_reg_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin non_seq_b_reg_i_1/O, cell non_seq_b_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net pulse_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pulse_reg_i_2/O, cell pulse_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net rand_reset_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rand_reset_reg_i_2/O, cell rand_reset_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net randomize_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin randomize_reg_i_2/O, cell randomize_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net seq_count_enable_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin seq_count_enable_reg_i_2/O, cell seq_count_enable_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net seq_ct/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin seq_ct/color_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell seq_ct/color_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net seq_ct/c_state_reg[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin seq_ct/rerun_reg_i_2/O, cell seq_ct/rerun_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#11 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net seq_timer_enable_reg_i_2_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin seq_timer_enable_reg_i_2/O, cell seq_timer_enable_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
